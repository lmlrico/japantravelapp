For the exam I made an SPA (besides the login and register pages) so that a user won't need to go to different pages to access information, the sidebar/side drawer displays the weather and the fetched places so that it will be easier for a user to look at them, with convenient links that goes to the foursquare listings for more detailed, there are also two ways of searching for points of interest in the map, one is by searching via a location i.e. a city or a street address, the other is by clicking the 'Search This Area' button at the bottom of the page, this will prompt the app to look for points of interests near the center of the map. There was also another two methods, one is triggered by the end of a drag motion on the map and the other was to search for places using Foursquare API but both make too much excessive calls so I scrapped them

As for following the code conventions, I tried to follow them to the best of my abilities but I am pretty sure that there will be deviations from what is excpected from the standards since I was eager to finish this as soon as possible. Truth be told I'm not happy with the finished app, there's more functionalities that I wanted to incoporate such as filtering for the places and also the ability so save/favorite places for easy access.
